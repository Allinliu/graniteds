GDS has been designed to be lightweight, robust, fast, and highly extensible. 

The main features of GraniteDS are : 

* An implementation of the <<graniteds.remoting,Adobe AMF remoting>> protocol and of the AMF3 data format, with out-of-the-box adapters 
	   for all usual Java frameworks.   
* An implementation of a <<graniteds.messaging,messaging>> framework based supporting Comet and Websocket transports 
	   which can connect to JMS servers.
* A <<graniteds.datamanagement,data management framework>> which simplifies the handling and synchronization of persistent data through
	   client and server applications.
