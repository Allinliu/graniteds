== Project overview

_Granite Data Services_ (GraniteDS) is an event-driven, cross-framework, Application Client Container (ACC), for building
Flex, JavaFX and native Android client applications connected to a Java EE backend.

The platform is completely open source and released under the http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html[LGPL 2.1, window="_blank"] license,
with the exception of some advanced modules released under a dual http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html[GPL 3.0, window="_blank"] /

GDS has been designed to be lightweight, robust, fast, and highly extensible. 

The main features of GraniteDS are : 

* A built-in <<graniteds.remoting,remoting>> API abstracting over all major Java EE frameworks (Spring, EJB, CDI) and JPA engines
	(Hibernate, OpenJPA, EclipseLink, DataNucleus).
* A built-in real-time <<graniteds.messaging,messaging>> API abstracting over Comet, Websocket and UDP transports, 
	which can integrate with JMS servers.
* A <<graniteds.datamanagement,data management framework>> which handles the synchronization of persistent data between
	client and server applications.
ifdef::flex[]
* A <<graniteds.gas3,code generation tool>> which replicates your data model and service components into a type-safe, bindable, client-side API.
endif::flex[]
ifdef::java[]
* A <<graniteds.gfx, code generation tool>> which replicates your data model and service components into a type-safe, bindable, client-side API.
endif::java[]
* The implementation of two fast and compact binary serialization protocols (<<graniteds.datamanagement,AMF3  and JMF data formats>>),
	supporting arbitrary complex data graphs.
