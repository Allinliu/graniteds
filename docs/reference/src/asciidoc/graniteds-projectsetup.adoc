== Project Setup

ifdef::flex[]
GraniteDS consists in a set of Flex libraries (swcs) and a set of Java libraries (jars). It is designed to be deployed in a Java application server and packaged in a standard Java Web application, either as a WAR file or as an EAR file. The configuration of a GraniteDS project will generally involve the following steps :

GraniteDS consists in a set of client libraries and a set of server libraries. It is designed to be deployed in a Java application server and packaged in a standard Java Web application, either as a WAR file or as an EAR file. The configuration of a GraniteDS project will generally involve the following steps : 
endif::java[]

. Add the GraniteDS server jars to the +WEB-INF/lib+ folder of the WAR file or the +lib+ folder of the EAR file 

. Add the GraniteDS listener, servlets and filters in the standard +WEB-INF/web.xml+ configuration file 

. Define the framework configuration of GraniteDS in the +WEB-INF/granite/granite-config.xml+ file 

. Define the application configuration of GraniteDS (remoting destinations, messaging topics...) 
    in the +WEB-INF/flex/services-config.xml+ 

ifdef::flex[]
. Link you Flex project with the GraniteDS swcs libraries and define the necessary Flex compiler options 
endif::flex[]
ifdef::java[]
. Build you Java client project with the GraniteDS libraries 
endif::java[]
 
NOTE: Depending on which framework and application server you use on the server (Spring, Seam...) and on the client, 
some of these steps may be completely omitted, or implemented differently. 
For example, when using the Spring framework on the server, almost all the configuration can be defined in the standard 
Spring context instead of the +granite-config.xml+ and +services-config.xml+ files. 
GraniteDS tries to be as transparent and integrated as possible with the application environment, 
however it can be useful to know how things work at the lower level in case you have specific requirements. 

[[setup.jars]]
=== Server libraries

The GraniteDS server libraries are available from the +libraries/server+ folder of the distribution. 
You will always need +granite.jar+ which contains the core features of GraniteDS.
Usually you will have to include the jar corresponding to

- your server framework (++granite-spring.jar++ for Spring for example)
- your JPA provider (++granite-hibernate.jar++ for Hibernate) 
- other integration libraries, for example ++granite-beanvalidation.jar++ if you want to benefit from the integration with the Bean Validation API on the server.  

[[setup.webxml]]
=== Configuring +web.xml+

At the most basic level, GraniteDS is implemented as a servlet (in fact a servlet and a filter) and thus has to be configured in +web.xml+. 
Here is a typical code snippet that maps the GraniteDS AMF servlet to +/graniteamf/*+.  
It's possible to define a different URL mapping if absolutely necessary but there is very little reason you would want to do this. 
It is also highly recommended to also add the configuration listener that will release resources on application undeployment. 

[source,xml]
----
<listener>
    <listener-class>org.granite.config.GraniteConfigListener</listener-class>
</listener>

<filter>
    <filter-name>AMFMessageFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.granite.messaging.webapp.AMFMessageFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>AMFMessageFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/graniteamf/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>

<servlet>
    <servlet-name>AMFMessageServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.granite.messaging.webapp.AMFMessageServlet</servlet-class>
    <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>AMFMessageServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/graniteamf/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
----

[[setup.graniteconfig]]
=== Framework configuration

The configuration of the various GraniteDS parts is done in the file +WEB-INF/granite/granite-config.xml+. 
There are many options that can be defined here, you can refer to the <<graniteds-configuration,configuration reference>>. 

As a starting point, you can create an empty file : 

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE granite-config PUBLIC "-//Granite Data Services//DTD granite-config internal//EN"
    "http://www.graniteds.org/public/dtd/3.0.0/granite-config.dtd">

<granite-config/>       
----

Or much easier let GraniteDS use class scanning to determine the default setup. 

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE granite-config PUBLIC "-//Granite Data Services//DTD granite-config internal//EN"
    "http://www.graniteds.org/public/dtd/3.0.0/granite-config.dtd">

<granite-config scan="true"/>    
----

[[setup.servicesconfig]]
=== Application configuration

The last thing to define on the server is the application configuration in +WEB-INF/flex/services-config.xml+.
This is for example the place where you will define which elements of your application you will expose to GraniteDS remoting, 
or the topic for messaging. You can refer to the <<graniteds.configuration,configuration reference>> for more details. 

For example a simple configuration for an EJB 3 service would look like : 

[source,xml]
----
<services-config>
    <services>
        <service id="granite-service"
            class="flex.messaging.services.RemotingService"
            messageTypes="flex.messaging.messages.RemotingMessage">

            <destination id="example">
                <channels>
                    <channel ref="graniteamf"/>
                </channels>
                <properties>
                    <factory>ejbFactory</factory>
                </properties>
            </destination>
        </service>
    </services>

    <factories>
        <factory id="ejbFactory" class="org.granite.messaging.service.EjbServiceFactory">
            <properties>
                <lookup>myapp/{capitalized.destination.id}ServiceBean/local</lookup>
            </properties>
        </factory>
    </factories>

    <channels>
        <channel-definition id="graniteamf" class="mx.messaging.channels.AMFChannel">
            <endpoint
                uri="http://{server.name}:{server.port}/{context.root}/graniteamf/amf"
                class="flex.messaging.endpoints.AMFEndpoint"/>
        </channel-definition>
    </channels>
</services-config>        
----

This configuration file declares 3 differents things, let's list them in the reverse order : 
 
* Channel endpoint: this defines the uri on which the remote service can be accessed though GraniteDS remoting.  
This should match the servlet url mapping defined previously in +web.xml+. Note that this uri will only be used when 
referencing this +services-config.xml+ file from the client.

ifdef::flex[]
NOTE: +server-name+, +server-port+ and +context-root+ are placeholders that are automatically replaced 
when running the application in the Flash Player.  
To run the application on the AIR runtime you will have to specify the real name and port of the server 
as it cannot be determined from the source url of the swf. 
endif::flex[]

* Service factories: here the configuration defines an EJB 3 factory, meaning that destinations using this factory 
will route incoming remote calls to the EJB 3 container.
GraniteDS provides factories for all popular server frameworks. 
Most factories require specific properties, here for example the JNDI format for EJB lookup. 

* Service/destinations: this section defines a remoting service (described by its class and message type) 
and one destination interpreted as an EJB 3 as indicated by the factory property. 

NOTE: Depending on the kind of framework integration that is used, the +services-config.xml+ file 
may not be necessary and can be omitted. 
With Spring and Seam for example, everything can be defined in the respective framework configuration files 
instead of +services-config.xml+. 

ifdef::flex[]
[[setup.swcs]]
=== Client libraries and setup

GraniteDS comes with two client +swc+ libraries that must be linked with your Flex application. 
The main library +granite.swc+ should be linked with the standard mode (__linked into code__), 
but the core internal library ++granite-essentials.swc++ must be linked with the compiler option ++-include-libraries++. 
When using the Tide client framework, you will also have to specify to the Flex compiler some annotations 
that should be kept in the ++swf++ for runtime usage.  
The following sections describe in more details these various options for different development environments. 

[NOTE]
====
Due to API changes since the Flex SDK 4.5, there is a different version of the +granite.swc+ library compiled 
and compatible with the Flex SDK 4.5+. It is named +granite-flex45.swc+ and must be used instead of the default +granite.swc+. 
====

When using a +services-config.xml+ file, it's necessary to use the compiler option +-services path/to/services-config.xml+ 
so the Flex SDK itself can handle the creation of the channel and other remoting objects. 
If you don't use this option, you will have to specify manually a channel and endpoint for each destination in ActionScript 3 : 

[source,actionscript]
----
private function init():void {
        srv = new RemoteObject("myService");
        srv.source = "myService";
        srv.channelSet = new ChannelSet();
        srv.channelSet.addChannel(new AMFChannel("graniteamf", 
            "http://{server.name}:{server.port}/myapp/graniteamf/amf"));
        srv.showBusyCursor = true;
}
----

[[setup.ant]]
=== Developing with Ant

_Ant_ is probably one of the most popular build tools. 
The Flex SDK comes with a set of ant tasks that can perform various development tasks, 
notably the compilation of the Flex application to a +swf+ file. 
The following XML code defines a typical target to build a Flex/GraniteDS application 
(the variable +$$FLEX_HOME$$+ should point to your Flex SDK installation directory) : 

[source,xml]
----
<taskdef resource="flexTasks.tasks" classpath="${FLEX_HOME}/ant/lib/flexTasks.jar"/>

<target name="compile.flex" description="Build swf from Flex sources">

     </mxmlc>
 </target>       
----
endif::flex[]

ifdef::java[]
[[setup.client.jars]]
=== Client libraries

+granite-client.jar+ is the core Java client library. It includes a stripped down version of the 
core server +granite.jar+ that includes the minimal core of GraniteDS necessary on the client and 
the core Java client library.

+granite-javafx-client.jar+ contains the Tide client framework and the specific integration for JavaFX. 

For remoting and Comet support, the GraniteDS client requires the Apache Asynchronous HTTP client, 
and for WebSocket, the Jetty WebSocket client. All these jars can be found in the +libraries/java-client/dependencies+ 
and +libraries/java-client/optional-websocket+ folders of the distribution. 

You simply have to add the necessary GraniteDS jars and dependencies to your application classpath. 
endif::java[]

[[setup.maven]]
=== Developing with Maven

_Maven_ is a popular build tool. Though GraniteDS itself is not built with Maven (all will probably never be), 
its artifacts are published in the Maven central repository and can thus be easily added as dependencies to any Maven project. 

The Java dependencies for the server application are in the group +org.graniteds+.

[[maven.archetypes]]
=== Using Maven archetypes

Building a full Flex / Java EE Web application with Maven is rather complex and implies to create a multi-module 
parent project with (at least) 3 modules : a Java server module, a Flex module and a Web application module, each having 
its own +pom.xml+, dependencies and plugin configurations.
It is thus recommended that you start from one of the existing GraniteDS/Maven archetypes : 

* GraniteDS/Spring/JPA/Hibernate: graniteds-flex-spring-jpa-hibernate
* GraniteDS/Tide/Spring/JPA/Hibernate: graniteds-tide-flex-spring-jpa-hibernate
* GraniteDS/Tide/Seam 2/JPA/Hibernate: graniteds-tide-flex-seam-jpa-hibernate
* GraniteDS/Tide/CDI/JPA: graniteds-tide-flex-cdi-jpa


Note than using Maven 3 is highly recommended though Maven 2.2 should also work.
A project can then be created using the following command : 

----
mvn archetype:generate
	-DarchetypeGroupId=org.graniteds.archetypes
	-DarchetypeArtifactId=graniteds-tide-flex-spring-jpa-hibernate
	-DarchetypeVersion=2.0.0.GA
	-DgroupId=com.myapp
	-DartifactId=springflexapp
	-Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT        
----

To build the application, just run : 
----
cd springflexapp
mvn install    
----

The Spring and Seam archetypes define a Jetty run configuration so you can simply test your application with : 
----
cd webapp
mvn jetty:run-war		
----

The CDI archetype defines an embedded GlassFish run configuration so you can test your application with : 

----
cd webapp
mvn embedded-glassfish:run        
----

To deploy your application to another application server (for example Tomcat), you may have to change the 
Gravity servlet in +web.xml+. Then you can build a +war+ file with : 
----
cd webapp
mvn war:war

Gravity servlet in +web.xml+. Then you can build a +war+ file with : 
----
cd webapp
mvn war:war 
----
endif::java[]

ifdef::flex[]
[[setup.flashbuilder]]
=== Developing with Flash Builder

There are different options for working with Flash Builder. The easiest is to use a single combined Flex/Java 
project that will contain the source files for both the server and client parts of the application. 

You should install the GraniteDS Eclipse Builder plugin (see <<gas3.eclipse,here>>) so you can benefit from the automatic 
Java to AS3 code generation. In can be installed in a standalone Flex/Flash Builder or in an Eclipse installation 
with the Flash Builder plugin. 

The first step is to create a new Java EE Web project. 
You can use the Eclipse WTP wizard (__File / New / Web / Dynamic Web Project__) :

Change the name of the source folder to +java+ instead of +src+ to avoir conflicts with the Flex source folder 
we will add later.

Then copy the necessary GraniteDS libs in the folder +WebContent/WEB-INF/lib+. It's done for the Java side. 

Next add the Flex nature to the project by right-clicking on the project and selecting _Add/Change Project Type / Add Flex Project Type..._. Then follow the steps on the wizard.

You may want to change the target build folder of Flex to +WebContent+ so the target +swf+ will be compiled 
directly in the exploded war folder.

You should change the source folder to +flex+ in the project properties in _Flex Build Path_ and 
define the target url so the Flex debugger will connect to the application deployed on the server :

Next copy the GraniteDS client libraries +granite.swc+ and +granite-essentials.swc+ to the +libs+ folder, 
and configure the compiler options in the project properties in +Flex Compiler+:

Finally we add the GraniteDS nature to the project with right-click / _Add GraniteDS Nature_. 
Remember to change the target folder to +flex+. The GraniteDS properties should like this :

If you have configured a target server (Tomcat for example), you now have a complete environment to run your application. 
All changes to the Flex application will be automatically deployed to Tomcat thanks to the Eclipse WTP 
automatic publishing of the +WebContent+ folder.
