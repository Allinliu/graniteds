	   for all usual Java frameworks.   
* An implementation of a <<graniteds.messaging,messaging>> framework based supporting Comet and Websocket transports 
	   which can connect to JMS servers.
* A <<graniteds.datamanagement,data management framework>> which simplifies the handling and synchronization of persistent data through
